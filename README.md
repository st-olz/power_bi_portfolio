# Power-BI Portfolio

In this repository a couple of Business intelligence projects with Microsoft Power BI will be added from time to time.

### #1 Superstore Sales
A very simple first project to understand basic functions of the software. The goal of this project is to model and analyze data from a sales records database and answer the questions beneath:

- What were the total sales for the company?
- Which market generated the most sales on average?
- What were the profits by segment? Which segment has the most profit?

The procedure is described in the attached notebook [superstore.ipynb](/superstore/superstore.ipynb).
